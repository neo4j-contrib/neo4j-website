<p>Last month, the <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> <a href="http://blog.neo4j.org/2009/06/community-buzz-heating-up.html">community buzz was heating up</a> but this month the heat has reached another level. <a href="http://friendfeed.com/toddh">Todd Hoff</a> of <a href="http://highscalability.com/">High Scalability</a> wrote a short post on <a href="http://highscalability.com/paper-graph-databases-and-future-large-scale-knowledge-management">Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a>, pointing to <a href="http://markorodriguez.com/Lectures_files/risk-symposium2009.pdf">slides (pdf)</a> by <a href="http://markorodriguez.com/Blarko/Blarko.html">Marko Rodriguez</a>. Hoff says:</p><blockquote><p>Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases.</p></blockquote><p>Then Hoff delved further into the subject and wrote a piece entitled <a href="http://highscalability.com/neo4j-graph-database-kicks-buttox">Neo4j - a Graph Database that Kicks Buttox</a>, which was widely read and and cited with <a href="http://geoffarnold.com/?p=3230">comments like</a>: <i>And donâ€™t just read this piece; bookmark it!</i> Here are some of his points:</p><blockquote><p>Decent documentation, active and responsive email list, a few releases, good buzz. All a good sign for something that has a chance to last a while.</p><p>Fully transactional like a real database. Supports JTA/JTS, XA, 2PC, Tx recovery, deadlock detection, etc.</p><p>Current implementation is built to handle large graphs that don't fit in memory with durability. It's not a cache, it's a fully persistent transactional store.</p></blockquote><p>The article has a discussion in the <a href="http://highscalability.com/neo4j-graph-database-kicks-buttox#comments">comments</a> and also spawned a discussion thread over at <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">MetaFilter</a> under the title <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/82478/Neo4j-traverses-depths-of-1000-levels-and-beyond-at-millisecond-speed">Neo4j traverses depths of 1000 levels and beyond at millisecond speed</a>, the latter going more into theoretical questions.</p><p>The next thing happening that made graph databases gain increased focus was this <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/large-scale-graph-computing-at-google.html">post about Pregel</a>, the graph mining infrastructure used internally at Google. It seems Pregel is oriented towards data analysis and not transactional applications.</p><p>It's not a coincidence there was a question on Stackoverflow specifically about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1000162/have-anyone-used-graph-based-databases-http-neo4j-org">graph databases and Neo4j</a>!</p><p><a href="http://community.devexpress.com/members/Julian-M-Bucknall.aspx">Julian M Bucknall</a>, CTO of <a href="http://devexpress.com/">Developer Express</a> wrote a piece on <a href="http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/ctodx/archive/2009/06/17/graph-databases.aspx">graph databases</a>. He mentions topics like scalability, schema evolution and the sparse table problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDBMS">RDBMS</a>s. In the core part of the article he writes:</p><blockquote><p>Finally -- and I'm not trying to nail down the coffin lid here, just pointing out issues with the relational model -- we have what might be called the social media issue or the six degrees of separation problem. More and more of our data forms a network or a graph. ... Persisting this kind of network model is not geared to a relational database ...</p></blockquote><p>The article <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/dev/should-you-go-beyond-relational-databases/">Should you go Beyond Relational Databases</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/martinkl">Martin Kleppmann</a> gives useful hints as to which kind of database could be useful in different applications. Of course he mentions graph databases and Neo4j: he contributed a <a href="http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Scala">Scala library for Neo4j</a>, capable of exposing domain specific RESTful JSON APIs. Next he started to collaborate with <a href="http://twitter.com/ronge">Andreas Ronge</a> on the <a href="http://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j/tree/master">Ruby wrapper for Neo4j</a>, which also includes a REST API. The new version including the REST stuff was <a href="http://news.neo4j.org/2009/06/neo4jrb-030-released-rest-support.html">just released</a>.</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/mattrepl">Matt</a> <a href="http://posts.dynamictyping.org/">Revelle</a> is improving on theClojure support for Neo4j and <a href="http://twitter.com/mattrepl/status/2191178863">tweeted</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Just pushed updates to clojure-neo4j. Plenty more to do, feedback welcome. #clojure #neo4j <a href="http://github.com/mattrepl/clojure-neo4j/tree/master">http://github.com/mattrepl/clojure-neo4j/tree/master</a></p></blockquote><p>If you like your code lispy, the clojure-neo4j library should be well worth a look.</p></div>
