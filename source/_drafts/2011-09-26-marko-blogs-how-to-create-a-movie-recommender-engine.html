Marko Rodriguez gives us a step by step guide to building a graph-based movie recommender engine using the publicly available <a href="http://www.grouplens.org/node/73">MovieLens dataset</a>, the graph database <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a>, and the graph traversal language <a href="http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com/">Gremlin</a>.<br /><br />He uses Toy Story to demonstrate traversing the MovieLens Graph, and<br /><b>Which users gave Toy Story more than 3 stars?</b><br /><b>Which users gave Toy Story more than 3 stars and what other movies did they give more than 3 stars to?</b><br /><b>How many of Toy Storyâ€™s highly co-rated movies are unique?</b><br /><b>Which movies are most highly co-rated with Toy Story?</b><br /><b>Which movies are most highly co-rated with Toy Story that share a genera with Toy Story?</b><br /><b>Which movies are most highly co-rated with Toy Story that share all generas with Toy Story?</b><br /></div>
