These are really exciting times to be working on a graph database. The fact that a number of companies are releasing graph databases is a great validation of what we have been saying from the start: It makes sense to model data in graphs! <br />It is a great feeling that there so many other graph databases published now:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a>. Of course. </li><li><a href="http://www.franz.com/agraph/allegrograph/">AllegroGraph</a>. A graph database that focuses on RDF and SemanticWeb.</li><li><a href="http://www.infinitegraph.com/about/">InfiniteGraph</a>. The newest player to join the scene. A Graph database built on same foundations as the <a href="http://www.objectivity.com/">Objectivity</a> object database.</li><li><a href="http://www.sones.com/">Sones GraphDB</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.dama.upc.edu/technology-transfer/dex">DEX</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.kobrix.com/hgdb.jsp">HyperGraphDB</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://infogrid.org/">InfoGrid</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://www.7-degrees.com/">7 Degrees</a>. Previously <a href="http://www.cogitoinc.com/">Cogito</a>.</li><li><a href="http://kloudshare.com/">KloudshareDB</a>.</li><li><a href="http://openquery.com/products/graph-engine">OQGraph</a>. Graph query engine for MariaDB (MySQL).</li><li><a href="http://www.infogrid.com/">InfoGrid</a>.</li><li><a href="http://4store.org/">4store</a>. An RDF database.</li><li><a href="http://www.contentengineer.com/cegwiki.php/Software/Graph-Database">FETL Graph Database</a>.</li><li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplegdb/">Simple GDB</a>.</li></ul>There are a number of abstraction layers on top of other databases to model graphs:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/twitter/flockdb">FlockDB</a>. A distributed set of MySQL databases that implement a graph databases optimized for one level adjacency.</li><li><a href="http://github.com/stevedekorte/vertexdb">VertexDB</a>. A graph database on top of Tokyo Cabinet (a key-value store).</li></ul>There are even a few databases that don't have graphs as their main focus, but that are adding support for graph queries:<br /><ul><li> <a href="http://riak.basho.com/">Riak</a>.</li><li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/orient/">OrientDB</a>.</li></ul>If you feel that your graph databases has been left out, I apologize, the purpose of this list was not to be complete but only to show that there are a large number of graph databases.<br />But graph databases aren't new new. <br />This leads to the natural question: Why are graph databases popular again?<br />The first part of the answer is the fact that the relational model isn't sufficient for all our needs anymore.<br />But what makes the graph databases of today better than the pre-relational ones? What do we have today that we didn't have in general programming 40 years ago? To me the answer seems pretty obvious (at least after squinting and tilting my head just slightly): Object orientation! The benefits of this for graph databases is two fold:<br /><ol><li>Working with an object oriented abstraction of a graph, with objects representing nodes and objects representing relationships is far easier than working with the pointers and records that&nbsp;</li><li>Working with an object oriented domain is easy on a graph.</li></ol>There are even some heavy names supporting this: <br /><blockquote>If we look at the object-oriented systems, they essentially have abandoned the relational model, as the basis of their object-oriented programming. They’re back to a network model because the relationships they support for the object-oriented programming. All of the data modeling tools are based on the network data model. If you think about the problem from a conceptual point of view, the network model is the survivor simply because it allows you to say more. Or say more, because you’re communicating with somebody else, and you want them to learn more about what you’re doing. The relational model doesn’t suffice for that purpose. </blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bachman">Charles W.
