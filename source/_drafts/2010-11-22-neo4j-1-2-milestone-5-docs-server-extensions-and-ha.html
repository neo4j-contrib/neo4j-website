Hi there,<br />this release, the community and the Neo4j team have been working hard to bring you some really long-term value in the Neo4j project, mainly Documentation and the first glimpse of the High Availability component.<br /><br /><h2>Documentation</h2><br />there now are the beginnings of a one-stop documentation that generates HTML output and PDF documents, giving you the reference documentation on using Neo4j and the related components. We hope this will make it much easier to find relevant information, get started and look up things that right now are hard to find on the Wiki, Blogs and other spread-out sources on the web.<br /><br />Also, this documentation will be versioned, so that for each Neo4j release there will be a corresponding version of the Neo4j Reference Manual. Eventually, we hope to evolve this into a book on Neo4j. If you want to contribute to the effort, let us know!<br /><br /><br /><h2>High Availability</h2><br />With this milestone, we are proud to for the first time release a version of the Highly Available Neo4j cluster to the community. This component turns Neo4j into a system with a Write-Master and a number of Read-Slaves. Upon mutating operations, at least the master and one slave are committing the transaction before propagating out the changes to the other slaves. In case of the write-master failing, the remaining slaves will automatically elect a new master. Also, the whole cluster infrastructure is transparent to the client code, so that all slaves and masters can be written to and read from. The client code does not need to be aware of the type of HA setup it is running on. Simple do<br /><br /><br /><h2>Other stuff</h2><br />For text indexing, the integration with Lucene has tightened. Hit scores are now exposed in IndexHits and you can set Similarity and also ask for top N hits, instead of all<br /><br /><br /><br /><pre><br />GraphDatabaseService db = new HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase( path, config );</pre><br /><br />and off you go as usual!<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>Server extensions</h2><br />One of the big possibilities with the Neo4j Server is to extend it. With this release, we are moving on to this by providing a simple way to mount your own REST resources into the server. This gives a number of interesting opportunities. Let's just think of a few that the community could contribute:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>take a script as a payload from a REST call and execute it on the server side (JavaScript, Gremlin, etc)</li><br /><li>Accept custom payload and execute it in a transaction on the server, good for instance for custom bulk inserts via REST</li><br /><li>write your own domain REST API</li><br /><li>on certain REST URLs, execute server-side scripts or resources, scripted in Java, Scala, Gremlin or JavaScript, effectively creating stored procedures.</li></ul><br /><br /></div>
