Thanks everyone for attending!</font><font style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br />What happens if I use Neo as a service, for internal use only, and it is not embedded in any other software package?</font><br />That's an interesting question. Accessing Neo4j through the built-in Webadmin does not require a license. A web browser communicates with Neo4j over the network, so it might seem that it is exposed to the AGPL requirements. However, a browser is obviously interacting with a generic http service. So this use would not require a license. </font><font size="3"><br face="arial"><br face="arial"></font><font face="arial" size="3">It's only when software has been created to interact specifically with Neo4j that integration occurs and licensing considerations come into play. Internal use versus external use does not affect licensing considerations. It's all about whether you have created software that is written to work with Neo4j. Such software should be open source, or acquire a commercial license.</font><font size="3"><br /><br face="arial"></font><font face="arial" size="3"><font style="font-weight: bold;">What if I want to use Neo as part of the SaaS services?    </font><br />Neo4j could be made available directly to end-users as part of a SaaS service, with the licensing obligations passed on to the users themselves rather than the service. </font><font size="3"><br face="arial"></font><font style=" color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" face="arial" size="3">[This requires a bit of thought actually. It could require an OEM license, but I'm not sure why.]</font><font size="3"><br /><br face="arial"></font><font face="arial" size="3"><font style="font-weight: bold;">What does "integrated software" mean?  If I run it as a standalone product that services API requests by other commercial software.  Is the other commercial software "integrated?"  </font><br />Integrated means writing software that conforms with the protocol of requests and responses exchanged through an interface. If the commercial software only corresponds with generic http or jmx services, then it is not integrated with Neo4j. If the commercial software interacts with Neo4j to perform graph operations for storing or querying data, then it has been integrated. </font><font size="3"><br face="arial"></font><font face="arial" size="3"><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">What if i download the enterprise package and use it in a saas application without buy the license?</font><br />That's an interesting question.

For now, our efforts with Heroku are focused on making it the best experience possible. </font><font size="3"><br /><br /></font><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);" face="arial" size="3">If this wasn't enough for you, and wish to know more about commercial licensing, download your free copy of our </font><font size="3"><a style="font-family: arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);" href="http://info.neotechnology.com/commercial-license.html">Commercial License Whitepaper</a><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">.</font><br /><br style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></font><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);" face="arial" size="3">Also, be sure to check out our </font><font size="3"><a style="font-family: arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);" href="http://info.neotechnology.com/newsletter-04.html">March Newsletter</a></font><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);" face="arial" size="3"> for upcoming webinars, events and meetups!</font><font size="3"><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zDf2KdRjKm0/T0_YpC0xb_I/AAAAAAAAAGw/5Ycy-RSeDk8/s1600/linkedinpic.jpg"><img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 116px; height: 116px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zDf2KdRjKm0/T0_YpC0xb_I/AAAAAAAAAGw/5Ycy-RSeDk8/s320/linkedinpic.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5715024651800899570" border="0"></a><br face="arial"><br /><br /><br /><font face="arial">-ayeeson</font><br style="font-family: arial;"></font></div>
