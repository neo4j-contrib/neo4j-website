Neo4j has a lot of features and intricacies, and I thought it would be beneficial to elaborate on what we mean when we discuss Neo4j's nuances.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Schema</font><br style="font-weight: bold;">Neo4j  is a schema-less database. Graphs are naturally flexible and have  expressive  structures. Structural conventions naturally arise in any  given  domain, and it is the responsibility of the developer to ensure a   high-fidelity transfer of these structures into the graph. Personally I   like to use tests to verify these structures are stable over time.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Consistency</font><br />Neo4j is a write-consistent database. Neo4j is ACID transactional and write consistency is one of the hallmarks of  such systems.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Durability</font><br />On transaction commit, all data is flushed to disk. <font style="font-style: italic;">There is no  window of opportunity for data to be lost</font>, once a transaction has been  accepted it is considered durable since even if the machine crashes, the  commit will be correctly recovered from the log.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Decentralized</font><br />When running Neo4j in HA mode, a master slave cluster is formed. In  this mode the slaves are eventually consistent with respect to the  master in the general case (unless you choose to write through a slave,  in which case that particular slave and the master will be temporarily  eagerly consistent). This configuration allows Neo4j to scale  horizontally for writes, however it requires that a full replica of the  data-set be present on each machine. This means it's impractical to use  Neo4j in this configuration for very large (many terabytes) of data  because it's inconvenient to have to replicate so much.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Stability</font><br />Neo4j has been in 24x7 production use since 2003. It currently runs  mission critical services from <a href="http://neotechnology.com/customers/">small start-ups to blue chip companies</a>  like Deutsche Telekom, Adobe, and Cisco.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Complexity of development</font><br />Neo4j supports a Java API and a REST API, and in each API a higher  level query language called <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.4/cypher-query-lang.html">Cypher</a> is available. There are many  libraries that will adapt these APIs for your preferred programming  language. Furthermore there is a 3rd party stack called <a href="http://tinkerpop.com/">Tinkerpop</a>  which provides another high-level query language called <a href="https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki">Gremlin</a>. Which  of these stacks you choose depends on your preference.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Security and Privilege</font><br />Neo4j can run in-process with your application, in which case it  benefits from the security features that you have built in. If you  choose to use Neo4j in server mode then the REST API is secured through  HTTPs for privacy and has a set of programmable rules to allow or  disallow access to different aspects of the server and data.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;">Reliable, Fault tolerance</font><br style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-weight: bold;"> </font>Neo4j is classified as as dependable system. It is a transactional  store which is fully recoverable. Furthermore the HA cluster provides fail-over in the event of machine failure.<br /><br /><font style="font-weight: bold;"> Support</font><br />Neo Technology offers a subscription-based licensing scheme for  those customers who are unable to use the software free of charge by  themselves being open source.<a href="http://www.blogger.com/groups.google.com/group/neo4j"> The  community support list</a> which is a completely free source of support  where users and Neo Technology staff mingle.<br /><br />For higher level support that comes with a commercial license, Neo4j provides an exceptional customer support model. Traditional tech support offers a tiered service where customers must use their valuable time in order to finally speak with an engineer that is able to address complex questions. Neo Technology works on a rotating support schedule, meaning that our best engineers working on the actual product take turns in providing support to customers. That way your questions are answered in a timely and highly proficient manner.<br /><br />Neo4j's support staff is also represented in a diverse set of time zones, including Asia, Europe and the US. That way, our customers don't fall victim to half-day lags (or worse) in responses.<br /><br />If you require even higher  levels of support we would be happy to talk to you about <a href="http://info.neotechnology.com/evaluation.html">consulting and  licensing options</a> to suit your requirements.
