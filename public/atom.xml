  <p>While custom control panels and plugins are great, one of the strongest points of SideWinder is it&#8217;s meticulous attention to details in the area of typography. Every major type element has been addressed; You can even change both the Title Fonts and Body Fonts with the flip of a switch in the dashboard; Heck, you can even disable the title-font-replacement if you feeling like straight forward web-fonts instead of the flashy new stuff.</p>

<h3>Superquotes</h3>
<div class="superquote">          
  95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a web designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: Typography.
</div>

<p>Optimizing typography is optimizing readability, accessibility, usability(!), overall graphic balance. Organizing blocks of text and combining them with pictures, isn’t that what graphic designers, usability specialists, information architects do? So why is it such a neglected topic?</p>
<p>Back in 1969, Emil Ruder, a famous Swiss typographer, wrote on behalf of his contemporary print materials what we could easily say about our contemporary websites:</p>


<!-- STANDARD BLOCKQUOTES -->
<hr />
<h3>Standard Blockquotes</h3>
<blockquote><p>Today we are inundated with such an immense flood of printed matter that the value of the individual work has depreciated, for our harassed contemporaries simply cannot take everything that is printed today. It is the typographer’s task to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed matter in such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him.</p></blockquote>
<p>With some imagination (replace print with online) this sounds like the job description of an information designer. It is the information designer’s task “to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed matter in such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him”.</p>
<p>Macro-typography (overall text-structure) in contrast to micro typography (detailed aspects of type and spacing) covers many aspects of what we nowadays call “information design”. So to speak, information designers nowadays do the job that typographers did 30 years ago:</p>

    <updated>2012-06-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://neo4j-org.heroku.com/blog/2012/06/12/neo4j-18m04-happy-paths</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<a href="https://github.com/tinwelint"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://neo4j.org/img/mattias.jpg" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 283px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; width: 204px;" /></a><br />Neo4j 1.8 Milestone 4 is available today, offering a few new ways to help you find happy paths. To query a graph you use a traversal, which identifies paths of nodes and relationships. This release updates the capabilities of Neo4j&#8217;s core Traversal Framework and introduces new ways to use paths in Cypher.<br /><h2>Graph Sherpa Mattias Persson</h2><a href="https://github.com/tinwelint">Mattias Persson</a>&nbsp;works throughout the Neo4j code base, but is particularly well acquainted with the Traversal Framework, a core component of the Neo4j landscape. He&#8217;s agreed to guide us on a traversal tour:<br /><em>AK</em>: So, what exactly is a Traversal?<br /><em>MP</em>: I would say from one or more given nodes in your graph move around to other nodes via their connected relationships in search of your answer. The traversal can be controlled in different ways, for example which relationships to traverse at any given position, ordering and so on. The general outcome is a list of paths from which the relevant information can be extracted.<br /><em>AK</em>: And the Traversal Framework, then. Is it just for describing a Traversal?<br /><em>MP</em>: Sure, it&#8217;s for describing where the traversal should go and also implementation to execute the traversal itself.<br /><em>AK</em>: Can you give an example, like how would I find the friends of my friends?<br /><em>MP</em>: So here the starting point is you, the node representing you. And you&#8217;d tell the traversal to follow KNOWS relationships or similar down to depth 2. Also every friend of friend should only be returned once (such uniqueness is by default). So in embedded code:<br /><pre class="brush: java">Iterable&lt;Node&gt; friendsOfFriends = traversal()<br />  .breadthFirst()<br />  .relationships(KNOWS)<br />  .evaluator(Evaluators.atDepth(2))<br />  .traverse().nodes();</pre><em>AK</em>: OK, interesting. It&#8217;s such a different way of querying, though. For people who are new to Traversals, what&#8217;s your advice for how to &#8216;get it&#8217;?<br /><i>MP</i>: Look at traversals as local, where instead of having your entire database and query globally by matching values, you start at a known point where your relationships becomes your index and lead you to what you&#8217;re looking for. So you describe how the traversal will behave, where it should go and not go and you receive callbacks about relevant data, as per your description.<br /><em>AK</em>: And what are the benefits of the new update to the Traversal Framework?<br /><em>MP</em>: There are some additions here. One is bidirectional traversals, which is essentially like describing two traversals, one from each side (meaning one or more given start nodes) and where they collide in the middle will produce results in the form of paths. In most scenarios where you know both the start and end node(s) a bidirectional traversal will get you your answer with much less relationships traversed, i.e. faster traversal. Reason being that number of relationships needed to be traversed on each depth increases exponentially, so by traversing half the depth from each side cuts down on that growth. The &#8220;all paths&#8221; and &#8220;all simple paths&#8221; implementations in the graph-algo collection uses bidirectional traversals now. Dijkstra and A* will probably move over to that as well, and it&#8217;s essentially just a small change in your traversal description to make it bidirectional.<br />There&#8217;s also an addition to the &#8220;expander&#8221;, i.e. the one responsible for deciding which relationships to follow given a position in the traversal. Previously it could only make decisions based on the node for the current position, but now it can view the whole path leading up to the current position.<br />Also some minor things like being able to get metadata about the traversal (number of relationships visited and so forth), more convenience methods on Path interface.<br /><i>AK</i>: Nice. That&#8217;s a lot of good stuff. How will REST users be able to take advantage of these new capabilities?<br /><i>MP</i>: Well, you can soon expect Cypher to optimize queries that can take advantage of it. That&#8217;s the usual thing, just keep writing queries and we&#8217;ll keep making them faster.<br /><i>AK</i>: Thanks so much Mattias for all the hard work.<br /><h2>Paths as Expressions</h2>In Cypher, much of the work in a statement involves working with paths. Now, paths themselves can be treated as expressions. This is most immediately explained with a simple example. Prior to 1.8.M04, you could capture a path with an identifier like this:<br /><pre class="brush: sql">START n=node(...), m=node(...) <br />    match p=n--&gt;()&lt;--m <br />    return collect(p) as allPaths</pre>With paths as expressions, that can be re-written as:<br /><pre class="brush: sql">START n=node(...), m=node(...) <br />    return n--&gt;()&lt;--m as allPaths</pre>Simply return the path that you want. There are, of course, much more fun things that can be done with this, which we&#8217;ll leave to explore another time. Because the best thing to do right now is&#8230;<br /><h2>Try Neo4j 1.8.M04</h2>Neo4j 1.8.M04 is available:<br /><ul><li>for immediate <a href="http://neo4j.org/download">download on Neo4j.org</a></li><li>provisioning on Heroku with heroku addons:add neo4j &#8211;neo4j-version 1.8.M04</li><li>discussion on the <a href="http://neo4j.org/forums">Neo4j Google Group</a></li><li>questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neo4j">Stack Overflow tag #neo4j</a></li></ul><br />Cheers,<br />the Neo4j Team</div>
